But came to know that, it supports only one bank a/c per one mobile number. That is a big inconvenience. After failing to link my joint account to my mobile through BharatPe, I tried to link my personal account as a test case. It worked. But then, I see that it can be linked only to one account. So now I am unable to purge this test case one and use BharatPe for the one which I really wanted. No clear answer from the support group. Just like adding a bank account to BharatPe, there should be a provision to remove it also.\n",
