I lost all my history, it keeps on looking for the sim card number with the phone and it's not letting me to use USA number which is my actual simcard. Even though we request an OTP, there is only option to auto detect but not manually enter the OTP. How stupid is the developer or the whole app development team to build something this dumb assuming this is more secure and forgetting the user friendly part 🙄\n",
